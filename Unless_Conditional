#This conditional will run unless code is true. 

players = ["Correa", "Carter", "Altuve"] #Setup array 
unless players.empty? #This conditional is checking if the "players" array is empty. If it is not empty then players will be displayed. 
players.each {|player| puts player}
end 

#Another way to write unless conditionals is like this: 
players = ["Correa", "Carter", "Altuve"] #Setup array 
if !players.empty? #The 'if !' syntax is saying this: if the players array is NOT empty then...
players.each {|player| puts player}
end 

#You can also put all of the components on one line like this: 
players = ["Correa", "Carter", "Altuve"]
players.each {|player| puts player} unless players.empty? #This is saying the following "for the players array iterate over each element and print out the player name...unless the players array is empty."
