#Hash is a key value pair collection. each element includes two elements. It includes the value and the key to that value. A hash can have another hash nested in it. 

positions = { first_base: "Chris Carter", second_base: "jose Altuve", short_stop: "Carlos Correa" }

positions = { "first_base" =>"Chris Carter", "second_base" =>"jose Altuve", "short_stop" =>"Carlos Correa" } #this is the same thing we just use a "hash rocket" for our syntax

positions = { :first_base =>"Chris Carter", :second_base =>"jose Altuve", :short_stop =>"Carlos Correa" } #Another way to write it 

#if i want to grab one of the positions...

positions[:second_base] #this calls out the element value I have in the given position. 

#typical array grabbing an element is like this:

x = [1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3]
x [2]

#the hash method can often be more practical for these situations because you can specify to grab a value that may change frequently.
