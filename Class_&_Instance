#There are several ways to call out a class. In this method we can simply tack on the defined object to the class. Therefore, all I have to do to print is to add ".print_out" to my Invoice class. 
Invoice.print_out #This prints "Printed out Invoice"

#To use the instance method I will have to store the instance to a variable. This can be helpful when using a class that has multiple methods in it.
