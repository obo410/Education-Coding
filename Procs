#Modules are methods (or processes) that can be stored inside of variables 
full_name=Proc.new { | first, last | first + " " + last } #this creates a new instance of a proc, within the curly brackets are a code block. We have two different arguments, first and last. 

full_name = Proc.new { |first| first*5 }
p full_name["Isaac"]

#another way we can write these is as follows: 
full_name = Proc.new do |first|
  first * 5
end
  
p full_name["Isaac"]


#note, ensure that p in proc is capitalized
