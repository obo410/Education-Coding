#This tutorial will show us how to create files and some general file know-how. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7cHdhXPOAA&index=49&list=PLgYiyoyNPrv9GUToqLWapjDoyk-yXThcp

File.open("files=lessons/teams.txt", 'w+') {|f| f.write("Twins, Astros, Mets, Yankees") #This will open a file called 'teams' and it will print the string Twins, Astros, Mets, Yankees

#r - reading 
#a - appending 
#w - just writing 
#w+ - read and write 
#a+ - open a file for reading and appending 
#r+ - opening a file for updating both read and write 


file_to_save = file.new("files=lessons/other_teams.txt", 'w+')
file_to_save.puts("A's, Diamondbacks, Mariners, Rangers") 
file_to_save.close #This will create a file 'other teams' and then print the string written above in the file.
