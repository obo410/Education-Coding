x = 10 
y = 100 
z = 10 

if x == y 
  if x == z 
    puts "equal to anything"
  end 
end 

#Above is a clunky way to write compound conditionals, below is a better syntax (more concise)

if x == y && x == z #This says 'if x is equal to y and z' 
  puts "from the if statement" 
  
end 

if x == y || x == z #This says 'if x is equal to y or x is equal to z'
  puts "or statement is true"
end 


#Another more complicated compound conditonal is as follows:

if (x == 10 && x == z) || x == y #says 'if x equals ten and x equals z, or x equals y'
  puts "from the if statement_2"
end
