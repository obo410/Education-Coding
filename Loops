#first define the variable, then setup the while loop condition, (think "while this condition is met...then this will occur") then define the interval for the variable and end it. 
#No other command is required after the loop is ended. The loop will solve when the program is run. 

i = 0 

while i < 10 
puts "Hey there"
i += 1 
end

#While loops require an increment value for the variable. An increment is needed because if there is none then the variable will always meet the while condition.
