#This tutorial will show us how to read files in Ruby. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oUZvSfaS-Q&index=50&list=PLgYiyoyNPrv9GUToqLWapjDoyk-yXThcp

teams = file.read("files-lessons/teams.txt") #This calls teams 

p teams #This will print the teams file as a string

p teams.split #This will convert the teams file into an array rather than a string

#What if we had multiple team files and wanted them all displayed in array format?

teams_one = File.read("files-lessons/teams.txt")
teams_two = File.read(""files-lessons/other_teams.txt"")


p teams.split(', ') + teams_two.split(', ') #This will display both files as arrays and delimited with commas. 

teams_master = teams.split(', ') + teams_two.split(', ') #We are setting what we just did to a variable 

#we can create a block that capitalizes the 'teams_master' array 

teams_master.each do |team|
