teams=["astros", "yankees", "rangers", "mets", "cardinals"]
#we want this array to be more practical. For example maybe we want to separate it into a string and put commas in between each element. Common for dumping strings into other file formats. 

#Join iterates over each value. It will iterate each value and then sparate the values. 

teams.join('&') #separates the array values as a string separated by an & sign. Returns "astros&yankees&rangers&mets&cardinals"
