#Now we will learn object oriented inheritance. With inheritance you have one parent class. see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qwlv4n0ZCo&index=46&list=PLgYiyoyNPrv9GUToqLWapjDoyk-yXThcp 

class ApiConnector
  attr_accessor :title, :description, :url 
  
  def initialize(title, description, url = "google.com") #defining the initialize method 
    @title = title #instance variables being defined 
    @description = description
    @url = url 
end
def testing_initializers #defining the method 
  puts @title #prints the elements of the class
  puts @description
  puts @url 
end 
end 

Class SmsConnector < ApiConnector #We are inheriting all of our methods from api connector 
def send_sms #A good practice is that each class should have one responsibility. In other words, our ApiConnector shouldnt send sms, and mail. 
end 


api = Smsconnector.new(title: "My title", Description: "My description", url: "yahoo.com") #able to use same format as api connector because we are inheriting the methods from it. We are creating new values but able to use the same methods including the initializer method.
