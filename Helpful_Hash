people = {jordan: 32, Tiffany:27, Kristine:10, Heather:29}

#Lets see how to add to a hash 

people[:leann] = 42 #This adds leann as a key and 42 as a value to the end of the hash 
people 
#what if we want to make the numbers the keys rather than the values and the names the values? 
people.invert #This swaps the keys/values 

people_2 = people.invert #This sets an array of value for the inverted array. 

people.merge(people_2) #This merges the people hash and the people 2 hash so that the people array represents the first five key-value pairs and then the people_2 hash represents the last 5 key-value pairs. 

#we can also convert the hashes into arrays, like so. 

people.to_a #This converts the people hash into a 5 separate arrays (one for each key-value pair) 
people.keys #This prints out all of the keys and puts them in an array. 

people.values #This prints out all of the values and puts them in an array
